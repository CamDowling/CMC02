# CMC02
Interactive communication of structural analysis examples using Jupyter Notebooks and OpenSees

To execute the notebooks, first download the required Python modules. This can be achieved by obtaining the requirements.txt file from the CMC02 repository, followed by 
executing the appropriate command in the terminal:

py -m pip install -r requirements.txt

Prior to executing this command, verify that the Python virtual environment has been activated and that the current working directory contains the requirements.txt file. 
For further guidance on installing Python modules, see pip documentation available at the following link: [pip documentation](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/user_guide/).Issues running the notebook may be encountered using the latest version of Python due to compatibility problems with some modules. It is recommended to use Python version 3.11 to run the notebook.
