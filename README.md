# CMC02
## Interactive communication of structural analysis examples using Jupyter Notebooks and OpenSees

Issues may arise when running the notebooks with the latest Python version due to compatibility problems with certain modules. It is therefore recommended to set up a virtual environment using Python version 3.11.

The required Python modules can be obtained by downloading the requirements.txt file from the CMC02 repository, and then executing the following command in the terminal:

py -m pip install -r requirements.txt

Prior to executing this command, verify that your Python virtual environment has been activated and that the current working directory contains the requirements.txt file. For further guidance on installing Python modules, see pip documentation available at the following link: [pip documentation](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/user_guide/).
